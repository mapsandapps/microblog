            I just pushed out a new game/quiz inspired by a game played in episode 1 of the 2020 season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Mol_(TV_series)" target="_blank">De Mol</a>.
            You can play it on <a href="https://mapsandapps.itch.io/city-triangulation-quiz" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.

        <h2>Fave games of 2020</h2>
        <p>

          <p>
            Note: these are just games I played in 2020, not necessarily games that were released in 2020.
          </p>
          <h3>Faves (in no particular order):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b class="green">Good Sudoku</b> &mdash; I've probably played this an average of 30 minutes a day for the last four+ months</li>
            <li><b class="green">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</b> &mdash; Gave me a reason to meet new people during a pandemic when most of my normal ways of meeting people were unavailable</li>
            <li><b class="green">Lonely Mountains: Downhill</b> &mdash; Such great game feel and replayability</li>
            <li><b class="green">Fall Guys</b> &mdash; Great fun both to play and to watch</li>
            <li><b class="green">Ordinary Puzzles</b> &mdash; Simple, but good design</li>
            <li><b class="green">Littlewood</b> &mdash; Spent a lot of time playing this before I picked up ACNH, which scratched the same itch</li>
            <li><b class="green">A Short Hike</b> &mdash; Short but great game feel and heartwarming story</li>
            <li><b class="green">Flipflop Solitaire</b> &mdash; Played this a lot early in the year</li>
            <li>Honorable Mention: <b class="green">Among Us</b> &mdash; I didn't play this at all myself, but I've loved watching people stream it</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            Some games that were noteworthy but didn't quite make the cut for various reasons:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b class="green">Dicey Dungeons</b> &mdash; I just started playing this at the end of 2020. Perhaps it will make the list for 2021?</li>
            <li><b class="green">What the Golf</b> &mdash; Lots of fun, but I rarely think "I want to play this right now"</li>
            <li><b class="green">Fast RMX</b> &mdash; All around good racing game, but nothing much noteworthy about it</li>
            <li><b class="green">Baba is You</b> &mdash; I just kept getting stuck on various levels but also didn't want to spoil them</li>
            <li><b class="green">Pair Solitaire</b></li>
            <li>Various sudoku apps by <b class="green">Cracking the Cryptic</b></li>
            <li><b class="green">Gin Rummy</b></li>
            <li><b class="green">Sagrada</b> &mdash; Great game but requires just a little too much concentration to make it a play-all-the-time game for me</li>
            <li><b class="green">Two Dots Scavenger Hunt</b> &mdash; Not sure how I even learned about this, but I like it more than most hidden object games</li>
          </ul>
